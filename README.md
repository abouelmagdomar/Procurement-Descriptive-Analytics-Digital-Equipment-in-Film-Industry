# INSY-446-Data-Mining-for-Business-Analytics

In this project, we conducted descriptive analysis on 20 years of film festival data to uncover correlations between camera choices and selection success, providing valuable procurement insights for film studios. Through statistical exploration, we identified key trends that informed data-driven decision-making in the industry.

To enhance data consistency and enable predictive analytics, we developed a Python-based data pipeline to web scrape and normalize film industry datasets. This included designing a custom indexing system for over 8,000 movies, streamlining data integration and analysis. Additionally, we applied data extraction, cleaning, and transformation techniques to ensure high-quality datasets for machine learning model development.

This project showcased my expertise in data analysis, web scraping, and predictive analytics.
